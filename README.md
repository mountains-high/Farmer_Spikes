# From Forecast to Field: Leveraging Spiking Neural Networks for Solar Energy Prediction in Agriculture

This project aims to leverage spiking neural networks for accurate next-day prediction of solar irradiance and greenhouse temperature, which can have a profoundly positive impact on sustainable agricultural practices worldwide. By optimizing the utilization of solar energy systems and regulating greenhouse environments, farming operations can reduce their reliance on fossil fuels, lower operational costs, and minimize their environmental footprint. Improved energy forecasting enables better resource allocation and integration of renewables into the power grid, promoting a transition towards clean energy sources. Additionally, optimized greenhouse temperature control can enhance crop yields and quality, contributing to increased food production and security.
